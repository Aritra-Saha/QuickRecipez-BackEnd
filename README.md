# QuickRecipez-BackEnd
Easy-to-make Recipes at the press of a button!
## General Information
This is the front-end of a native mobile camera app that allows the user to take a picture of foods they want to cook with and returns to the user a list of recipes with information such as a title, description, directions, ingredients and nutritional value.
## Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow
* Google Cloud Platform
* Flask
* Beautiful Soup
* Kaggle
## Inspiration
We were inspired by our nights at university where we would get hungry but were sick and tired of eating fast food. We wanted something home cooked and so we decided to develop this app to help solve our problem. It will allow university students like ourselves to take pictures of foods that they have lying around and get tasty and easy to make recipes that they can make.
## What we Learned
We learned how to use the TensorFlow Object Detection API and how to train a TensorFlow Model. We learned how to create a REST API using Flask and how to deploy this type of server on Google Cloud. We also learned how to parse Kaggle datasets and extract their information which is then stored in JSON files. Also, we became more familiar with web scraping using Beautiful Soup.
## Challenges
* Dependecy Issues
* Training the Tensorflow Model
* Github Issues
* Parsing the Kaggle Dataset
* Sleep deprivation
* Bridging the front-end and back-end
